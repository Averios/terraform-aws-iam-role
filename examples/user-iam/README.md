example/user_iam
================

This example will create an IAM Role for users with `AdministratorAccess` managed policy attached.

This example will not be succesfully applied unless you change the value of `trusted_users`.
Currently the AWS Account with that Account ID is not exist, that is why the value must be changed first.
